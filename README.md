Investment Portfolio Tracker DashboardThis is a simple, single-file HTML and JavaScript application designed to help users track transactions for investments, particularly those involving small units of measure (e.g., milligrams of a commodity).The dashboard uses the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) accounting method to accurately calculate the realized Profit & Loss (P&L) when assets are sold. All data is processed client-side and can be loaded from or saved to a local CSV file.FeaturesSingle-File Application: Easy to run—just open dashboard.html in your browser.Client-Side Data: All data management is done locally via CSV files (no database required).FIFO Calculation: Automatically calculates the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Realized P&L for "Sell" transactions using the FIFO method.Tax Handling: Automatically separates the 3% tax from the total paid amount for "Buy" transactions.Visualization: Displays a time-series chart of price per milligram (Price/mg).Summary Metrics: Provides key figures like Total Investment, Total Revenue, Total Realized P&L, and Current Balance Weight.Getting StartedClone or download this repository.Open the dashboard.html file in any modern web browser.Start by adding transactions using the "Add New Transaction" form or load existing data using the "Load Transactions (CSV)" button.Expected CSV File FormatThe application strictly expects 7 fields in the CSV file, in the exact order listed below. These fields represent the raw, fundamental data required for the FIFO calculation and reporting.HeaderDescriptionRequired for TypeCalculation NotesDateThe date the transaction occurred (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY).AllMust be a valid date string.TypeThe nature of the transaction.AllMust be exactly Buy or Sell.SpentThe Base Cost of the purchase (pre-tax amount).BuyFor Buy, this is Total Paid / 1.03.

For Buy, it must be 0.00.TaxThe tax amount paid (3% of the total amount).BuyFor Buy, this is Total Paid - Spent. For Sell, it must be 0.00.WeightThe quantity of the asset transacted, in milligrams (mg).AllMust be a positive numeric value.COGSBasisThe calculated Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) used for the sale.SellFor Sell, this is the original cost of the units being sold (calculated via FIFO). For Buy, it must be 0.00.Example CSV DataDate,Type,Spent,Received,Tax,Weight,COGSBasis
15/06/2019,Buy,194.17,0.00,5.83,56.70,0.00
17/06/2019,Buy,194.17,0.00,5.83,56.80,0.00
15/11/2020,Sell,0.00,10.19,0.00,2.00,7.05
